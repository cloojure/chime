* Chime

Chime is a *really* lightweight Clojure scheduler.

** Dependency

Add the following to your =project.clj= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [jarohen/chime "0.2.2"]

#+END_SRC

** The ‘Big Idea’™ behind Chime

The main goal of Chime was to create the simplest possible
scheduler. Many scheduling libraries have gone before, most attempting
to either mimic cron-style syntax, or creating whole DSLs of their
own. This is all well and good, until your scheduling needs cannot be
(easily) expressed using these syntaxes.

When returning to the grass roots of a what a scheduler actually is,
we realised that a scheduler is really just a promise to execute a
function at a (possibly infinite) sequence of times. So, that is
exactly what Chime is - and no more!

Chime doesn't really mind how you generate this sequence of times - in
the spirit of composability *you are free to choose whatever method
you like!* (yes, even including other cron-style/scheduling DSLs!)

When using Chime in other projects, I have settled on a couple of
patterns (mainly involving the rather excellent time functions
provided by [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html][java.time]] - more on this below.)

** Usage

Chime consists of two main function, =chime-ch= and =chime-at=.

*** =chime-ch=

=chime-ch= is called with an ordered sequence of
[[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html][instants]], and
returns a channel that sends an event at each time in the sequence.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:require [chime :refer [chime-ch]]
            [clojure.core.async :as a :refer [<! go-loop]])

  (let [chimes (chime-ch [(.plusSeconds (Instant/now) 2)
                          (.plusSeconds (Instant/now) 3)])]
    (a/<!! (go-loop []
             (when-let [msg (<! chimes)]
               (prn "Chiming at:" msg)
               (recur)))))
#+END_SRC

=chime-ch= uses an unbuffered channel, so cancelling a schedule is
achieved simply by not reading from the channel.

You can also pass =chime-ch= a buffered channel as an optional
argument. This is particularly useful if you need to specify the
behaviour of the scheduler if one job overruns.

=core.async= has three main types of buffers: sliding, dropping and
fixed. In these examples, imagining an hourly schedule, let's say the
3pm run finishes at 5:10pm.

- With a =sliding-buffer= (example below), the 4pm job would be cancelled, and the
  5pm job started at 5:10.
- With a =dropping-buffer=, the 4pm job would start at 5:10, but the
  5pm job would be cancelled.
- In the unbuffered example, above, the 4pm job would have been
  started at 5:10pm, and the 5pm job starting whenever that finished.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:require [chime :refer [chime-ch]]
            [clojure.core.async :as a :refer [<! go-loop]])

  (let [chimes (chime-ch times {:ch (a/chan (a/sliding-buffer 1))})]
    (go-loop []
      (when-let [time (<! chimes)]
        ;; ...
        (recur))))
#+END_SRC

You can =close!= the channel returned by =chime-ch= to cancel the
schedule.

*** =chime-at=

=chime-at=, on the other hand, is called with the sequence of times,
and a callback function:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:require [chime :refer [chime-at]])
  (:import [java.time Instant])

  (chime-at [(.plusSeconds (Instant/now) 2)
             (.plusSeconds (Instant/now) 4)]
            (fn [time]
              (println "Chiming at" time)))
#+END_SRC

With =chime-at=, it is the caller's responsibility to handle
over-running jobs. =chime-at= will never execute jobs of the same
scheduler in parallel or drop jobs. If a schedule is cancelled before a job is
started, the job will not run.

=chime-at= returns a zero-arg function that can be called to cancel
the schedule.

You can also pass an =on-finished= parameter to =chime-at= to run a
callback when the schedule has finished (if it's a finite schedule, of
course!):

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (chime-at [(.plusSeconds (java.time.Instant/now) 2) 
             (.plusSeconds (java.time.Instant/now) 4)]

            (fn [time]
              (println "Chiming at" time))

            {:on-finished (fn []
                            (println "Schedule finished."))})

#+END_SRC

*** Recurring schedules

To achieve recurring schedules, we can lazily generate an infinite
sequence of times. This example runs every 5 minutes from now:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:import [java.time Instant Duration])

  (defn periodic-seq [^Instant start duration-or-period]
    (iterate #(.addTo duration-or-period %) start))

  (-> (periodic-seq (Instant/now) (Duration/ofMinutes 5))
      rest) ; excludes *right now*
#+END_SRC

To start a recurring schedule at a particular time, you can combine
this example with some standard Clojure functions. Let's say you want
to run a function at 8pm New York time every day. To generate the
sequence of times, you'll need to seed the call to =periodic-seq= with
the next time you want the function to run:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:import [java.time LocalTime ZonedDateTime ZoneId Period])

  (periodic-seq (-> (LocalTime/of 20 0 0)
                    (.adjustInto (ZonedDateTime/now (ZoneId/of "America/New_York")))
                    .toInstant)
                (Period/ofDays period-days))
#+END_SRC

Chime does drop any times that have already passed from the front of
your sequence of times (on the condition that the sequence is ordered)
so it doesn't matter whether 8pm today has already passed - Chime will
handle this gracefully.

*** Complex schedules

Because there is no scheduling DSL included with Chime, the sorts of
schedules that you can achieve are not limited to the scope of the
DSL.

Instead, complex schedules can be expressed with liberal use of
standard Clojure sequence-manipulation functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:import [java.time ZonedDateTime ZoneId Period LocalTime DayOfWeek])

  ;; Every Tuesday and Friday:
  (->> (periodic-seq (-> (.adjustInto (LocalTime/of 0 0)
                                      (ZonedDateTime/now (ZoneId/of "America/New_York")))
                         .toInstant)
                     (Period/ofDays period-days))

       (filter (comp #{DayOfWeek/TUESDAY DayOfWeek/FRIDAY}
                     #(.getDayOfWeek %))))

  ;; Week-days
  (->> (periodic-seq ...)
       (remove (comp #{DayOfWeek/SATURDAY DayOfWeek/SUNDAY}
                     #(.getDayOfWeek %))))

  ;; Last Monday of the month:
  (->> (periodic-seq ...)

       ;; Get all the Mondays
       (filter (comp #{DayOfWeek/MONDAY}
                     #(.getDayOfWeek %)))

       ;; Split into months
       ;; (Make sure you use partition-by, not group-by -
       ;;  it's an infinite series!)
       (partition-by #(.getMonth %))

       ;; Only keep the last one in each month
       (map last))

  ;; 'Triple witching days':
  ;; (The third Fridays in March, June, September and December)
  ;; (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_witching_day)

  ;; Here we have to revert the start day to the first day of the month
  ;; so that when we split by month, we know which Friday is the third
  ;; Friday. (Any times that have already passed will be dropped, as
  ;; before)

  (->> (periodic-seq (-> (.adjustInto (LocalTime/of 0 0)
                                      (-> (ZonedDateTime/now (ZoneId/of "America/New_York"))
                                          (.withDayOfMonth 1)))
                         .toInstant)
                     (Period/ofDays period-days))

       (filter (comp #{DayOfWeek/FRIDAY}
                     #(.getDayOfWeek %)))

       (filter (comp #{3 6 9 12}
                     #(.getMonthValue %)))

       ;; Split into months
       (partition-by #(.getMonthValue %))

       ;; Only keep the third one in each month
       (map #(nth % 2))))
#+END_SRC

This is quite a different approach to other scheduling libraries, and
therefore I would be very interested to hear your thoughts!

** Error handling

As of 0.1.1, you can pass an error-handler to =chime-at= - a function
that takes the exception as an argument. You can either re-throw it,
to prevent future occurrences of the scheduled task; or squash it to
try again at the next scheduled time.

By default, Chime will re-throw the error to the thread's uncaught exception
handler.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (chime-at [times...]
            do-task-fn
            {:error-handler (fn [e]
                              ;; log, alert, notify etc?
                              )})
#+END_SRC

** Behaviour of =(Instant/now)=

Sometimes, you'll want a schedule along the lines of 'every <x>
<time-unit>'. The temptation here is to create a sequence of times
with: =(periodic-seq (Instance/now) (Duration/ofMinutes 5))= - however, this can lead
to non-deterministic behaviour. Sometimes Chime will run the function
immediately, sometimes it won't.

The reason for this is a combination of two factors:
- Chime removes times in the past from your sequence. This is so that,
  when you want a schedule like '6am daily', you can pass that, without worrying
  whether 6am has already passed today.
- There's a slight delay between your call to =(Instant/now)= and Chime's
  check for times in the past. Chime resolves times
  to the nearest millisecond so, if these two checks occur in the same
  millisecond, your schedule will run immediately - if not, it won't.

The solution to this is to exclude =(Instant/now)= from the schedule -
achieved with something like =(rest (periodic-seq (Instant/now) (Duration/ofMinutes 5)))=.

** Testing your integration with Chime

Testing time-dependent applications is always more challenging than
other non-time-dependent systems. Chime makes this easier by allowing
you to test the sequence of times independently from the execution of
the scheduled job.

(Although, don't forget to wrap your infinite sequences with =(take x
...)= when debugging!)
